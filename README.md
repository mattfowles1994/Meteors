# Meteors
Finished project based on the Course 'Python for Everybody' Coursera

I chose data taken from the NASA website regarding recorded meteors

I first created the file Imports Json.py which took the JSON  file from the NASA website, extracted the data and put this data into a database using SQL

The database consisted of a main table and 2 sub tables which were linked to the main table via foreign keys

I then pulled out the data using the file gline.py and created a simple Javascript file from this to act as a series of data points

The HTML file was provided by the course

Once opened the data points are plotted onto a graph displaying the number of recorded meteorites which fell per year.
